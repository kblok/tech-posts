# How to be productive while working with Stored Procedures in SQL Server

## Introduction
Whether you got working on a project with many stored procedures, you're a DB geek or you just simply find that stored procedures is the right tool for you job, 
you will face many challenges if you want to keep your team productive while working on these kind of projects.

## What's wrong with Stored procedures?
I won't try to sell the idea that stored procedures are the best tool and that everybody needs to throw away all their ORM code, I believe that every team has to choose the best tool that first it's the right tool for the problem and 2 makes the team productive.
The problem I do see is that even when coding a feature in a stored procedure is the right choice, developer won't go that way just because they won't be productive on that technology,
and it will be more likely because of one of these problems:

### Centralized
Teams tend to have only one SQL Server with a bunch of different versions of the same database, e.g. Dev, Test or CI.
So, if one developer makes a change in the DEV database it will affect others developers **immediatelly**. Some teams will try to mitigate this problem trying to alter the database as little as possible, and when they do so they would @channel at Slack (no please don't @channel), send an email or even yelling at the office.
